### A letter to future members: 

<div class="largefont">
We strive to build a unique working culture that is: 

* **Friendly:** treating every member with mutual respects is the minimal requirement. Here, we, including myself, are all friends. 

* **Supportive:** we are here to help and support each other. As a team, we will go through all ups and downs during the process.
